 * Initialized repository, created server.py and README.
# There are a bunch of weird characters on the following line.
 * Modified code to return an HTTP 1.0 response with a ‘200 OK’ response line, a Content-type of text/html and a message body with header Hello, world  and the rest of the body saying “this is aliomars Web server”.
 * Added in the optional print c.recv(1000)
	* Found out that it prints information about the user that connected such as information about the OS, browser, language. It also contains information about the server.
